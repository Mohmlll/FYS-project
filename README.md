# Project Fasten Your Seatbelt (FYS)
This was my first ever programming project that I ever made.
We were assigned to make a website for the company Corendon.

This website is made with HTML/CSS JavaScript and MySQL
This website is made with raw html and CSS, we didnâ€™t use any external CSS libraries.

The parts I put most of my time to in this project were:
- The forum (showing the posts and being able to interact with them)
- Profiles and contacting
- Registration
- Responsive design

I personally can find my own growth looking back at this project.

We were given a 9 as grade for this product.
